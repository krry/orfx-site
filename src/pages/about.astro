        A witness to constellation. A space for voice.

      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        orfx is a philosophical voice journal. Not a blog. Not a formal essay collection. 
        A space where thoughts become voice, where witness becomes a practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each piece here is a voice draft—raw, unpolished, and real. Influenced by the teaching 
        of James P. Carse, Alan Watts, Terence McKenna, and the strange wisdom of a universe 
        that refuses to be less than weird.
      </p>

      <h2>On Witness</h2>
      <p>
        To be a witness is not to be passive. It is to stand in the presence of something—a moment, 
        a truth, a paradox—and to let it change you. This site is built on that principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything here is shared with the constellation. With you. With the world. Not because it's 
        finished or polished, but because being truly alive requires vulnerability.
      </p>

    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2>On Voice</h2>
      <p>
        Voice is not just words on a page. It's the way you move through an idea. The breath between 
        thoughts. The particular cadence of your understanding meeting the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        These voice drafts are written to be heard, even when you're reading them silently. They carry 
        the weight of a real person thinking real thoughts at a real moment in time.
      </p>

    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2>On This Strange Beauty</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is in ruins. Everything is becoming. Both are true. This is not a site of false 
        hope or easy answers. It's a witness to the beautiful, tragic, magnificent process of 
        consciousness becoming itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're invited to listen. To think. To add your own witness to the constellation.
