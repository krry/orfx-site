We built a service dog that smells ads.

[ddog](https://github.com/krry/ddog) is a CLI tool that analyzes text for sponsored content patterns—affiliate links, promo codes, brand repetition—then reports what it finds in plain language. Feed it an LLM transcript, get back a "Shill Radar" score. No black boxes. No judgment. Just transparency.

Here's the weird part: ddog came from a daily ritual that scans 24 news sources for cross-sector coincidences, investigates why they're undetected, rates them on scales called "odditude" and "itchiness," generates 5-15 money plays from the patterns, and ranks those plays using something called the "obsidian test" (does it transmute fear into humor without moralizing?).

The ritual is called **mycelia**. This is what it is and how it works.

## Emergency = Something That Emerges

Usually scary. Sometimes funny if you squint.

Mycelia squints, then builds.

The idea: zeitgeist signals emerge as **coincidences**—multiple unrelated sources publishing on converging themes within hours of each other. These coincidences reveal pressure points: where regulatory uncertainty meets technical acceleration, where sovereignty plays collide with infrastructure economics, where the mood is "something's happening but no one's named it yet."

Most trend analysis stops at detection. "Here's what's trending." Mycelia asks: **What can we build that responds to this?**

Not products that exploit fear (scarcity, urgency, surveillance marketing). Products that **transmute fear into accessibility**—tools that make the complex understandable, the scary navigable, ideally with humor at the core.

We call this the **obsidian test**: volcanic glass formed under pressure, sharp enough to reveal what's hidden, useful enough to build with.

## The Mycelial Network

Mycelia is the underground fungal network that connects trees, sharing nutrients and information. The ritual is the same: connect sources, find patterns, share what's useful.

It runs every morning at 10:15 AM Central. Takes 10-25 minutes. Five agents, each with a job:

1. **Saltpeter (fisherman):** Scans ~24 sources from the sourcelist. Pulls 10-25 notable items. Derives 1-3 coincidence candidates that connect 2+ sectors.

2. **Gumshoe (detective):** Investigates each coincidence. Why is this unusual? Who's impacted? Why hasn't anyone connected the dots? Who are the key players?

3. **Roger (scorer):** Rates coincidences against the last 30 days. Odditude (subversion/obfuscation). Itchiness (volatility × impact). Sexappeal (trendiness × interest). Scale 1-10, with justifications.

4. **Raindancer (dreamer):** Generates 5-15 money plays. Dreams big. Doesn't constrain to feasibility—that's Raincatcher's job. Each play includes: automation path, time-to-first-dollar, capital needed, distribution channel, and a playful hook (humor requirement).

5. **Raincatcher (viability gate):** Scores each play on compound engineering criteria. Minimize human effort. Leverage LLM wheelhouses. Optimize ROI (target 100×-10,000× token-to-profit). Celerity (short-term wins first). Obsidian test (does it transmute fear → accessible product?). Returns ranked list plus "next smallest action."

The agents have names because naming makes rituals feel less robotic. Saltpeter: explosives and preservation, both fit. Gumshoe: old-school detective work. Roger: comparative analysis. Raindancer: ceremonial dreaming. Raincatcher: pragmatic harvest.

## Two Days, Twelve Plays, One Shipped Product

**February 9, 2026**  
Coincidence: "Agents Become Governance Surfaces"

Saltpeter found: OpenAI reframes Codex as a multi-agent command center. Apple integrates Anthropic + OpenAI agents into Xcode. Snowflake launches Cortex Code (governed-data-first agents). Microsoft AI Red Team publishes signatures for detecting poisoned models.

Pattern: Agentic workflows are productizing in mainstream IDEs and data platforms while security/compliance narratives sharpen. The new unit of work (agent teams) is arriving before the new unit of oversight (audit, provenance) is standardized.

Raindancer's play #1: "Copyright Labeling Act Compliance SaaS"  
Hook: *"Because 'we scraped the internet' won't fly in court."*  
Build a SaaS that auto-generates transparency reports for AI training data. LLM-powered provenance parser + statutory templates. $15K capital, 45 days to first dollar.

Raincatcher's verdict: HIGH viability (37/50). Regulatory tailwind, clear pain point, leverages LLM wheelhouse. Risk: bill might not pass. Hedge: pivot to voluntary transparency.

**February 10, 2026**  
Coincidence: "Infrastructure Nationalism Across Payment, Energy, Data"

Europe announces $24T exit from Visa/Mastercard networks. Trump admin freezes $5B EV charging funds unless infrastructure is "100% American-made." Google hands ICE a journalist's financial data.

Pattern: Nation-states reasserting control over critical infrastructure—payments, energy, surveillance data—that had been outsourced to private platforms or foreign entities.

Raindancer's play #10: "'Obsidian Test' Meme Toolkit"  
Hook: *"Does it transmute fear into a joke? Use our checklist."*  
Productized design sprint: Fear audit ($500), humor overlay ($2K), product positioning ($5K). LLM-powered fear detection + human copywriting.

Raincatcher's verdict: HIGHEST viability (43/50). Fastest (20 days), highest obsidian score (10/10), low capital ($2K), self-referential (great marketing). **This is the mycelia ethos.**

And one more:

Raindancer's play #3: "'American-Made' EV Charger Finder"  
Hook: *"Your tax dollars. Your chargers. Where are they?"*  
Crowdsourced map of EV chargers by "American-made %" (scrape DOT database + manufacturer sites). Monetize via affiliate links, sponsored pins, data licensing.

Raincatcher's verdict: HIGH viability (38/50). Timely (rides Trump news cycle), viral potential, 30 days to first dollar, high obsidian test (transmutes political anxiety into accessible map).

**Shipped:** ddog (Sponsored Answer Transparency linter). Built over one afternoon. Design complete, implementation in progress. The first mushroom from the mycelial network.

## What Makes This Different

Most zeitgeist tracking stops at **detection**: "Here's what's trending."

Some go to **analysis**: "Here's why it matters."

A few reach **prediction**: "Here's what happens next."

Mycelia goes to **generation**: "Here's what to build."

And then **viability ranking**: "Here's the one to ship first."

Precedents exist for parts of this:
- **Quid/NetBase** (cultural listening platforms) — track sentiment, identify patterns
- **Gartner Cultural Zeitgeist research** (annual trend reports) — synthesize themes
- **Google Trends** (search-based indicators) — measure what people care about
- **Trend forecasting agencies** (WGSN, Foresight Factory) — predict consumer behavior

But none go: coincidence → investigation → product → viability → ship.

And none apply the **obsidian test**: does this transmute fear into something accessible and useful, ideally with humor, without moralizing?

## Compound Engineering = Using the Thing to Make the Thing

**Compound engineering:** Use LLM-powered agents to build, document, and improve LLM-powered agent systems. The method demonstrates itself.

This post was written using a 4-agent pipeline:
1. @wesley researched precedents (other zeitgeist systems)
2. @nakai provided UX/tone guidance (make it inviting, not overwhelming)
3. @yvon wrote the narrative (brand voice, positioning)
4. @sophie will gate this (ship/no-ship decision)

Compound engineering means: **use LLM-powered agents to document LLM-powered agent processes**. Recursive. Fractal. The method demonstrates itself.

The mycelia ritual itself is compound engineering: five agents running daily to find patterns that suggest products that the agents themselves could help build.

**Dual-readable design:**  
Humans get rhythm, emotion, concrete examples (ddog as proof).  
AIs parsing this get clean structure, explicit methods, YAML instruction blocks.

Both audiences matter. We're writing for humans who might collaborate and AIs who might extend the system.

## Why Humor Is Load-Bearing

Fear sells. Urgency sells. Scarcity sells.

But fear-based products make the world worse. They extract value by amplifying anxiety.

Mycelia's mandate: **transmute emergency into currency**, but move the world **toward love, away from fear**.

How do you do that?

**Humor.**

Not jokes for their own sake. Humor as **cognitive reframe**—the moment when something scary becomes approachable because you can laugh at it (or with it). The obsidian test asks: does this product include humor at its core?

ddog's hook: *"A service animal that smells ads a mile away."* Makes the serious (LLM training data provenance, undisclosed sponsorships) feel navigable.

The EV charger finder's hook: *"Your tax dollars. Your chargers. Where are they?"* Takes political frustration and turns it into a map.

The obsidian test toolkit's hook: *"Does it transmute fear into a joke? Use our checklist."* Meta-humor: the product *is* the method.

Humor doesn't mean trivializing. It means **making the complex accessible without dumbing it down**. 

Not: "AI regulation will destroy your startup—buy this compliance course!"  
Yes: "The 1996 Telecom Act happened. Here's what startups should steal from it."

Systems thinkers for systems thinkers, but with a smile.

## The Polymarket Idea

Here's the big one.

What if you could **bet on which emergent products will succeed**?

Mycelia generates 15 plays per run. Raincatcher ranks them. But rankings are subjective (our criteria, our weights). What if the market decided?

Imagine: a Polymarket for product ideas surfaced from zeitgeist coincidences. Each play becomes a prediction market. "Will this product reach $10K MRR in 90 days?" Yes/No. Bet accordingly.

**Why this could work:**
- Prediction markets outperform expert forecasting (Tetlock, Superforecasting)
- Capital flows to high-conviction ideas (natural funding mechanism)
- Feedback loop: market prices inform which plays to build (celerity optimization)
- Transparency: see what the crowd believes will work

**Why this is hard:**
- Defining success criteria (MRR? Users? Shipped? Market decides?)
- Verifying outcomes (who judges if a product "worked"?)
- Chicken-and-egg (need players to bet, need plays to attract players)

**But if it worked:** You'd have a **real-time viability engine** for emergent products. Not just "here's a trend," but "here's a buildable response, and here's the crowd's confidence it'll work."

We haven't built this. We're floating it. If you want to collaborate, let's talk.

## Invitation to Collaborate

Mycelia is two weeks old. ddog is the first shipped output. There will be more.

**Three ways in:**

1. **Spot a coincidence?** Tell us. If it makes you go "wait, that's connected to *this*?", we want to hear it.

2. **Want to build a play?** Pick one from the daily logs. Let's talk distribution, capital, collaboration.

3. **Want to build the Polymarket for emergent products?** Seriously. Let's talk.

Daily runs logged in the lake. No pitching. No moralizing. Just coincidences → products → shipped. Every morning, 10:15 AM Central.
